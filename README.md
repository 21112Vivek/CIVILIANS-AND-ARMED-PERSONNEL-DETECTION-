# CIVILIANS-AND-ARMED-PERSONNEL-DETECTION

This project detects **guns** and classifies people as **uniformed** (e.g., army/police) or **civilian** using YOLO models. It raises an alert when a **civilian with a gun** is detected and organizes outputs into `alert/` and `normal/` folders with visual annotations.
